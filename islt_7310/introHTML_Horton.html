Hello! I’m Ashley Horton and I live in Ozark, Missouri. I have a Bachelors in Elementary Education, a Masters in School Administration K-12, and I’m currently working on my Specialist in Learning Technologies and Design. I took Introduction to Web Development in the Fall. I had some previous experience with coding but most of it was self-taught. I wanted to take the beginner course before Intermediate Web Development. With that said, the courses were redesigned and here I am! I’m already looking forward to this class because although the material looks to be similar, I’m finding the way the modules and content are set up to be way more user-friendly than my previous course. Eventually, I hope to find myself designing online learning for educators. Aside from teaching and my coursework, I love spending time with my family and two dogs. You can also just about always find me with a good book.
