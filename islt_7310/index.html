    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Ashley Horton. I live in Ozark, Missouri with my husband, two boys, and two dogs. My husband teaches high school science, my oldest is six and started kindergarten this year, and my youngest will be three in July and runs the house. I have a passion for all things technology and design and Iâ€™m an avid book reader.</p> 
    
    <p>I have been an elementary educator for the past nine years. I have experience teaching grades third through sixth as well as summer school experience with early elementary. I have a Master of Arts degree in K-12 School Administration and currently working on my Educational Specialist in Learning Technologies and Design. My long-term goal is to work as an instructional designer, preferably for a curriculum company or university. My top five strengths are communication, significance, empathy, strategic, and futuristic.</p>
