    <h2>Goal 1</h2>
    <h4>Objective 1.1</h4>
    <p><em><strong>Writing with an Author's Eye</strong></em></p>
    <p>This artifact was a very large group project that I worked on with two other classmates for ISLT 9471 – Instructional Systems and Design. The purpose of this project was to construct a type of learning development course for educators. My team and I created a three module, eLearning professional development course titled <em>Writing with an Author’s Eye.</em> This piece of work includes learning objectives, needs/task analysis, evaluations, learning experiences, and instruction. I am very proud of what we accomplished and, with some restructuring, would be able to implement this professional development at my site. </p>

    <h2>Goal 2</h2>
    <h4>Objective 2.2</h4>
    <p><em><strong>Research Proposal</strong></em></p>
    <p>This artifact is currently still in the works. A reflection will be added once the project and course are complete.</p>

    <h2>Goal 3</h2>
    <h4>Objective 3.1</h4>
    <p><em><strong>Digital Media Portfolio</strong></em></p>
    <p>This project was a lot of fun to work on. To begin, I had to create a graphic using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I originally planned on using Photoshop as the main program since I was most familiar with it, but I quickly learned that Illustrator was better suited for what I was wanting to accomplish. The second assignment was to used Adobe Audition to edit recorded audio. I had basic experience with editing audio through other programs. This was the first time I learned about and utilized different effects and multiple tracks. The next project involved recording and editing video using Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, and WeVideo. This was the first time I used a green screen and different types of shots, angles, and motion. The final piece to this portfolio was a learning activity that encompassed everything I had learned. I used Genial.ly to showcase different interactive features. Throughout this process, I reflected on each piece of my portfolio. I have gone back to some of these pieces to make adjustments since completing the course.</p>
