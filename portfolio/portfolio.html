    <h2>Goal 1</h2>
    <h4 class="objectives">Objective 1.1</h4>
    <p><em>Students are able to design/develop learning and performance opportunities and systems including direct instruction, constructivist learning, collaborative work, and performance support.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Writing with an Author's Eye</strong></em></p>
    <p>This artifact was a very large group project that I worked on with two other classmates for ISLT 9471 – Instructional Systems and Design. The purpose of this project was to construct a type of learning development course for educators. My team and I created a three module, eLearning professional development course titled <em>Writing with an Author’s Eye,</em> for which I was responsible for the Deconstructing and Reconstructing portion. For the report, I completed the needs/task analysis, contextual analysis, and implementation plan. This piece of work includes learning objectives, needs/task analysis, evaluations, learning experiences, and instruction.</p>
    <p>I am very proud of what we accomplished and, with some restructuring, would be able to implement this professional development at a site. This course was challenging, but I learned the importance of knowing your learners and using a backwards design process. This is something I have been able to take to my new position as an instructional designer and work closely with our course writers to ensure students' needs are being met.</p>

    <h4 class="objectives">Objective 1.2</h4>
    <p><em>Students are able to design/develop learning opportunities and systems for meaningful learning; promote student engagement in online learning environments; and select appropriate technology and learning objects to support learners.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Adobe Captivate - Mixtures and Solutions</strong></em></p>
    <p>Using the Adobe Captivate rapid development tool, I created a stand-alone module using 4th and 5th grade science standards. This module is engaging, interactive, and informative to learners. It features drag and drop activities, matching, a branching scenario, and a three question multiple choice and matching quiz.</p>
    <p>Creating a storyboard and learning about the different types of prototyping methods was definitely new to me. I am usually one to jump into these types of projects and find that it takes a long time to get through them because I’m so focused on the small details and not forgetting anything. My storyboard definitely helped me envision exactly what I was wanting my final prototype to look like.</p>
    <p>This class was a challenge and Adobe Captivate definitely is something that takes some skills. I really enjoyed this class though and getting to work with the software. What I struggled with the most was incorporating the variables and conditional. I felt that I would set up an advanced action, but then it would negate something I already set up and I couldn’t figure out how to make them both work the way I wanted to. This was probably the most frustrating part of this course. However, one ability that I gained from this course is being able to create meaningful online learning that is engaging and can still be assessed.</p>

    <h4 class="objectives">Objective 1.3</h4>
    <p><em>Students are able to conduct project management activities for both design/development, and implementation of learning opportunities and systems.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>New LMS Training for Teaching Staff</strong></em></p>
    <p>This artifact demonstrates the project management side of development. For my project, I created the idea of a new LMS (Canvas) training for teaching staff. As my document demonstrates, I identified the purpose, goals and objectives, success criteria, stakeholders, and scope specifications for my project. I worked in SmartSheets, a project management software, to develop a work breakdown structure (WBS) and utilized a Gantt chart to view the necessary tasks. I also created a project end checklist in Smartsheets to acknowledge the final steps of the project.</p>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this project and developed a passion for project management, something I was not even aware of as a career path. With a background in leadership, project management seems to be something that plays to my strengths. I learned how to break down a task to the bare basics in a work breakdown structure and I learned how to use a project management tool. With my current position, we use Monday Board to track our work. Completing this project helped me identify the steps necessary for implementing a new LMS.</p>

    <h2>Goal 2</h2>
    <h4 class="objectives">Objective 2.1</h4>
    <p><em>Students are able to conduct analysis in order to translate and use theoretical frameworks and existing research to design/develop learning opportunities and systems.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>ASK System</strong></em></p>
    <p>When I developed this ASK System, I was a virtual teacher. It was the middle of the pandemic and students and parents were being asked to do something they had never done - attend school virtually. I was constantly fielding questions, questions that students needed answered in order to be successful. I would receive messages from my students and their parents that required an immediate response, which was difficult to do when I was live on Zoom. This ASK System answers all of the need to know questions for students to be successful in my virtual classroom. It covers questions not just specific to my classroom, but to the LAUNCH program as well.</p>
    <p>What made this project simple to develop is that it was immediately applicable. I assessed a need, conducted a needs analysis, and designed a learning system to solve the problem, keeping backwards design in mind. The end productwas a learning opportunity beneficial to a large group of stakeholders: parents, students, teachers, etc.</p>

    <h4 class="objectives">Objective 2.2</h4>
     <p><em>Students are able to manage and optimize analytics collected by learning and performance systems to develop criteria to measure learning impact and talent development.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Research Proposal</strong></em></p>
    <p>I developed a research proposal on the topic of trauma interventions in the classroom and the effect they have on a school's atmosphere. I have spent my entire education career working in low-income, high-poverty schools where my students have faced trauma on a day-to-day basis. Factoring into that is the number of mental health disorders that are increasing among children. With this proposal, I plan to conduct qualitative research using a multiple case study design. The study would consist of an in-depth analysis of a specific trauma-intervention program.</p>
    <p>Writing this research proposal reintroduced me to the formal research process. I learned how to use quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches to research and how to connect theory and viewpoints to those methods. I learned about the different aspects of ethics rules and the importance of compliance. I can now understand and discuss the implications of mass data collection and determine, analyze, and mitigate ethical problems inherent in all stages of the research process.</p>

    <h2>Goal 3</h2>
    <h4 class="objectives">Objective 3.1</h4>
    <p><em>Students demonstrate technology leadership and knowledge of ethics as applied to current and future socio-technical context.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Learning Analytics</strong></em></p>
    <p>This artifact is an in-depth analysis of data comparing the beginning of year and middle of year iReady Reading testing scores for grades K-5 in a low-income public school. The purpose of this project was to gain experience and knowledge with data analysis including identifying variables as signal or noise, data cleaning/wrangling, and ethics. I wanted to analyze data that would have an immediate impact on my career. At the time, I was a classroom teacher and was looking for how I could best serve my students and prepare them for testing in the spring. Not only was I looking for how best to group my students, but I was looking for any correlation between their status (IEP, non-IEP, male vs. female, grade level, and ethnicity) and their growth percentage.</p>
    <p>One role of being a leader is having the ability to analyze data and apply the findings to work towards a common goal. For this data analysis, the goal was to find trends among different sub-groups that could be proven useful when planning for instruction, future assessments or for intervention purposes. Teaching in a low-income school offered the potential for excuses to be made about student performance. As I address in my report, this led to a reflection on correlation vs. causation and the need for a deeper analysis to determine if, for example, homelessness is a cause for low academic performance.</p>
    <p>This project was one that hit close to home as I was directly analyzing my students and those in my building. It illustrates the importance of ethics in data analysis and demonstrates my ability to take a large set of data, wrangle it, analyze it, and ultimately use it for instruction.</p>
